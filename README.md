The player would be playing with a bot where in the player and the bot would select the coordinates of their six ships and each side must guess the location of their opponents ship and shoot that location
If either the player or the bot correctly guessed the location of one of their opponent's ship, that ship would be shot, thus the ship would be sunk.
Whichever side sinks all of their opponents ships wins the game

Status of the Program: COMPLETE. (Completed in 2021)
Note: The program still has bugs since it was made while I was in highschool. No patches are planned for this program as of now.
